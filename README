Note: to run this project on Windows or Linux/Mac with DB H2, MySQL and SQL*Plus:
1. Drop and load the music database
   cd to the database directory here.
   and use the db tools there.
   
2. Use "mvn clean package" when cd'd to this directory to build/rebuild the jar

3. On Linux or Mac, use "chmod +x *.sh" to make all shell scripts in this directory
 executable, and similarly for the database directory. 

4. Run the program to start tomcat with the webapp: using convenience script
    runJarByProfile h2 web  (Windows)   
or  runJarByProfile.sh h2 web (Linux or Mac)
or using mvn directly (see contents of runMvnByProfile). Either way, let it hang.

5. Browse to localhost:9003/welcome.html to see the top-level page.

6. Run all the JUnit tests with mvn test. They are also run during mvn package.

7. The old line-oriented programs can be run outside of tomcat:
    runJarByProfile h2 SystemTest  (Windows)   (or TakeOrder or ShopAdmin)
or  runJarByProfile.sh h2 SystemTest  (Linux or Mac)
or  runMvnByProfile h2 SystemTest, etc.

To use a real DB: you need to define environment variables
 For Oracle database, set up env variables ORACLE_USER, ORACLE_PW, ORACLE_SITE
 For MySQL use, set up env vars MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PW, MYSQL_SITE
Then these are accessed from the profiles to setup the JDBC config.
So you can run simply  runJarByProfile oracle web   for example, and
let it hang.  Use a browser to run the webapp as in step 5.

To see Java files browse into src/main/java/.. 
For all JSP's browse to src/main/webapp/...

Inside eclipse:
For development and debugging, run SBApplication as a Java app inside eclipse,
or debug as a Java app. By default these will run the web case using Oracle.
To run using H2, define an eclipse Run configuration with VM arg 
-Dspring.profiles.active=h2 (look in the Arguments tab). To run SystemTest, 
add the program arg SystemTest in the Arguments tab.
